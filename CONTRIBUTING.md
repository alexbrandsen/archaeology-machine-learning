## making a pull request
This repository's contents is written in [github flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). To manage changes to the project's content we use [github's standard workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), which is based on contributors making requests for their changes to be pulled into the main project content (or, a pull request!).

To make a pull request:
1. [create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of this
   repository on GitHub
2. [clone your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) of this repository to create a local copy on your computer
3. [create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) in your local copy for each significant change
4. [commit the changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) in that branch
5. push that branch to your fork on github
6. [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) from that branch to the master repository
7. if you receive feedback, make changes in your local clone and push them to your branch on github (the pull request will update automatically)
8. pull requests will be merged  after at least one other person has reviewed the pull request and approved it
