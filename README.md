# 👋 welcome to the archaeology machine learning repository

## 📖 introduction to the project
Machine learning (ML) techniques are growing in popularity in archaeology and present new ways of approaching archaeological research questions. 
This repository documents the application of ML techniques to archaeological data.
This project aims to assist both those currently working in the field and new participants by:

* providing an overview of the ways ML is being applied in archaeology
* sparking new ideas whilst reducing duplication of work
* collecting together the resources needed for work be built upon

The repository is structured into technique sections with linked examples illustrating the applications of each technique.
This project is a work in progress and is starting by documenting applications for remote sensing data, but has a roadmap (link) towards including further data types.
