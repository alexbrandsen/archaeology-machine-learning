# 👋 welcome to the archaeology machine learning repository

## 📖 introduction to the project
Machine learning (ML) techniques present new ways of approaching archaeological research questions and interest in applying these methods continues to grow. 
This repository documents the application of ML techniques to archaeological data, aiming to assist those working in the field by:

* providing an overview of the ways ML is being applied in archaeology
* sparking new ideas whilst reducing duplication of work
* encouraging the sharing of code, data, and other resources
* making resources more [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reuseable)

By doing this, we hope to support practitioners to critically apply, or contribute to conversations about, machine learning techniques for archaeology.

## ✅ how to contribute
This project is open for contributions! Check out the project [🗺️ roadmap](https://github.com/lakillo/archaeology-machine-learning/issues/3) for contribution ideas and guidelines.

## 🙏 acknowledgements
This project was inspired by the [satellite-image-deep-learning](https://github.com/satellite-image-deep-learning/) project, and was kicked off as part of [Open Seeds cohort 8](https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/ols-8/).
