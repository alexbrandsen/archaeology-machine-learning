# 👋 welcome to the archaeology machine learning repository

## 📖 introduction to the project
Machine learning (ML) techniques present new ways of approaching archaeological questions and the number of projects using these techniques continues to grow. 
This repository documents the application of ML techniques to archaeological data, aiming to assist those working in the field by:

* providing an overview of the ways ML is being applied in archaeology
* sparking new ideas whilst reducing duplication of work
* encouraging the sharing of code, data, and other resources
* collecting together the resources needed for work be built upon

The repository is structured into technique sections with linked examples illustrating the applications of each technique.
This project is a work in progress and is starting by documenting applications for remote sensing data, but has a roadmap (link) towards including further data types.
