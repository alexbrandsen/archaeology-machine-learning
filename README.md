# 👋 welcome to the archaeology machine learning repository

## 📖 introduction to the project
Machine learning (ML) techniques present new ways of approaching archaeological research questions and interest in applying these methods continues to grow. 
This repository documents the application of ML techniques to archaeological data, aiming to assist those working in the field by:

* providing an overview of the ways ML is being applied in archaeology
* sparking new ideas whilst reducing duplication of work
* encouraging the sharing of code, data, and other resources
* collecting together the resources needed for work be built upon
